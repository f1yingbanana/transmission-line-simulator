Documentation:

Most of the code has comments in them. Most public methods have docstrings.

For people trying to create executables: try looking into kivy's recommended
packagers. However I have attempted and failed at packaging such an executable.

For people looking to speed up the app: matplotlib is the major bottleneck.
Multiple oscilloscopes slow down the whole system to a complete stop.

Attempted:
1. Multithreading the redrawing: graphs start to flicker and become unreadable.
2. Spacing the redrawing: the perceived lag is still there since graph updates
   slowly.
3. Replacing matplotlib: there IS another package supported in Kivy on Kivy
   garden, but it is severely lacking features.
4. Why are we even coding this in python: required by teaching professor. IMHO
   we will be much better off coding this on any other platform...
